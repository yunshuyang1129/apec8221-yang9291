# Introduction

This is my first reproducible document for APEC 8221 using \[Personal/Enterprise\] GitHub.

## Basic R Skills

```{r}
# Demonstrate basic R commands
library(tidyverse)

# Create some data
my_data <- data.frame(
  x = 1:10,
  y = (1:10)^2 + rnorm(10, 0, 5)
)

# Summary statistics
summary(my_data)

# Store values for inline use
mean_x <- mean(my_data$x)
```

The average of variable `x` is `{r} round(mean_x, 1)`.

## My First Plot

```{r}
ggplot(my_data, aes(x = x, y = y)) +
  geom_point(size = 3, color = "steelblue") +
  geom_smooth(method = "lm", se = FALSE) +
  labs(
    title = "My First Reproducible Plot",
    x = "X Variable",
    y = "Y Variable"
  ) +
  theme_minimal()
```
