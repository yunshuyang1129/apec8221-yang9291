```         
## Objective 
This is my first Quarto document for APEC 8221
```

```         
## Data  
Here is a data frame of pets:
```

```{r}
pets <- data.frame(
  name   = c("Fido", "Whiskers", "Nemo"),
  animal = c("Dog",  "Cat",      "Fish"),
  age    = c(5, 8, 2)
)
```

```{r}
pets
```

```{r}
max_age <- max(pets$age)
max_age
```

## Now, let's see the output when we print the data frame:

```         
## Analysis  

The maximum age of the pets is 8.
```
